Oops... I put the wrong URL on the Rev-1 release tag.  You can order Rev 1 of this board from OSH Park here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/a4fI5XNS (I receive no commission.)

Double-oops, there is no soldermask threaded between the pins of U1 in Rev-1.  This flaw is not a show-stopper.  It would have been nice to have.  

This has been fixed by reducing the solder mask expansion in Rev 1.1 to 1.8 mils.
